# Chess Club
### A digital chess application for users to play against the friends in a controlled, local environment.

[Project Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZTdou8GcfjnSwbaHYGpdr7wLTNhY2PdwEAnkHvlRxDw/edit?usp=sharing)

This is a chess application that allows relatively small groups of people to form a chess club in which users can play against each other and record data on their games.

A standard chess **Elo rating system** will be used to rate players relative to the others in this local environment.

The current design prototype will always be available [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c69d7aa0-3008-43f1-ae82-ca3a8763aeab-93ce/).
Note that this is very WIP, and much of the design is incomplete and/or tentative.

Throughout the development process, builds will be updated and can be previewed [here](https://volcaus.pythonanywhere.com/chessapp)

That repo can be imported to [py4web](https://github.com/web2py/py4web) and used as an app as is.
