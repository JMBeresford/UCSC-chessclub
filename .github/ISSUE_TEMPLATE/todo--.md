# TODO Title Goes Here

## Short description goes here

<Add image(s) here if needed>

### Description:
<add here>

### Elements that are given:
<add here>

## TODO:
- Inputs (props)
  - 
- Data
  - 
- Methods
  - 
- Outputs
  - 
 
## Once Completed:
### You should create a git commit with the at most the following changes:
- `templates/<filename>.html` with any changes to the template (unlikely, but allowed)
- `static/js/components/<component_dir>/<filename>.js` which includes the Vue component and/or additional javascript as needed
- `static/css/<component_dir>/<filename>.scss` for the styles for this component (regular css works in `.scss` files! This file *must* be used)
  - Any additional `.scss` files can be used so long as they are in the `static/css/<component_dir>/` directory
  - **Make sure** you include them in the existing `<filename>.scss` file with `@use(<new_filename>)` (no, the `.scss` is not needed)
