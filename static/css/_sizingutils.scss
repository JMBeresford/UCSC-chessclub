// This file will contain reusable sizing utilities that should be consistent across the project.

/// This utility 'clamps' an element's width to a min of 100px, and a max of 1000px
/// but when in between, maintains 'width: 80%;'. This is useful to maintain consistent margins
/// across the entire project.
///
/// ex:
///
/// body {
///   width: $span-center; -> width: clamp(100px, 80%, 1000px);
/// }
$span-center: clamp(100px, 80%, 1500px);

/// In case we require padding to push things down below the header (which is absolutely positioned)
$header-height: 100px;
