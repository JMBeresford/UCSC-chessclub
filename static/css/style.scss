// The following is global styling options. Additional .scss files can be created with
// additional style rules for other components of the site and included using the above syntax.
// This will help modularize our project so that each individual can work on their own portions
// without interfering with each other. If you create new style rules, simply come here and include
// them in the above section. Also take note of the global styles so you aren't confused as to why
// certain things are behaving the way they are (for example the animations on <a>'s)
// This functionality specifically requires using Dart Sass (rather than node-sass)
// The popular VS Code extension "Live Sass Compiler" uses node-sass, so use the alternative
// "dartsass" extension while working on this
